## Description

This is a command-line application that generates a high-quality, professional README file for a new project. The README file includes sections for Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions, making it easy for other developers to understand what the project is about, how to use it, how to contribute, and how to report issues.

As a developing web coder, the README Generator project was important for me to create because it allowed me to practice my command-line skills and develop a tool that can be useful for other developers. By completing this project, I gained practical experience with command-line applications, Node.js, and Markdown formatting, which are all important skills for a web developer to have.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br>
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository<br>
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions<br>
WHEN I enter my project title<br>
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README<br>
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions<br>
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests<br>
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options<br>
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under<br>
WHEN I enter my GitHub username<br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile<br>
WHEN I enter my email address<br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions<br>
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents<br>
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
