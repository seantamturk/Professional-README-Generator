## Description 

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. It prompts the user to input information about their application repository, and generates a high-quality, professional README file with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

As a web developer, this application simplifies the process of creating a high-quality, professional README file for new projects, allowing me to focus more on the actual development work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application should prompt the user to input information about their application repository.
- The generated README file should have a title matching the user's input.
- The generated README file should have sections for Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions, with the appropriate information provided by the user.
- The application should provide a list of options for the license, and add a badge for that license near the top of the README with a notice added to the License section that explains which license the application is covered under.
- The Questions section should include the user's GitHub username with a link to their GitHub profile and their email address with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
- The Table of Contents links should take the user to the corresponding section of the README.
